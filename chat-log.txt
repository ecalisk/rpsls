JackFrost|Hey, do you use spaces or tabs for indentation in your code?
USER|Spaces, obviously. Tabs are evil.
JackFrost| What? No way. Tabs are way more efficient. You only need one character to indent.
USER|But what if you need to change the indentation level? With spaces, you just change the number. With tabs, you have to replace all the tabs with spaces.
JackFrost|That's not true. Any decent text editor can convert tabs to spaces and vice versa.
bastelfreak|Can we please talk about something more interesting?
nicole|Yeah, this is a never-ending discussion and y'all know that.
JackFrost|Okay, fine. Do you want to settle this with a game of rock paper scissors lizard spock, USER?
USER|Best of three?
JackFrost|Sure, let's do this.
bastelfreak| I'll referee.
nicole| This should be good.
bastelfreak| Ready? Go!.
